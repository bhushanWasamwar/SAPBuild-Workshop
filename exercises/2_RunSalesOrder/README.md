# Step 1 <br>
## Release business process project <a name="releaseproject"></a>
<br>
To run the process you have to first release and then deploy the business process project.<br>

Releasing a project creates a version or snapshot of the changes and deploying the project makes it available in runtime to be consumed. You can only deploy a released version of the project, and at a given time there can be multiple deployed versions of the same project.<br> <br></br>
